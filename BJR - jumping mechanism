BJR-Bipedal jumping robot
pneumatic cylinders are used because they are small,light,and high power to weight ratio,it can store energy easily and reduces jumping time.
torsion springs store energy and provide flexibility to the joints,increases the torque ouput of the joint.
key factor behind the success of a jumping mechanism are the actuation systems whose aim should be to release high energy in a short period of time.
To decrease the collision impact and increase the stability when landing the feet are made bigger which increases the point of contact.
the joint joint torque output is influenced by the synergy between cylinder and the torsion spring.
the control system structure consists of PC which is the main source of all the commands that are to be given to the robot.
the controller receives the information from the PC and changes the solenoid valve.
By changing the solenoid valve,the pneumatic system output and transfer power make leg extension and contraction during jumping and landing.
Software part:-
1) Task layer plans the overall tasks according to the obstacle and terrain information.
2) Gesture layer sets parameters and plans trajectory.
3) Jump layer is responsible for coordinating the actuated joints.
4) Joint layer is responsible for extending and contracting joints.

Order of opening of various joints during jumping :- knee->hip->ankle
opening of knee joint leads to shifting of center of mass in a forward and upward direction,and ankle joint opens in the last to give the bot stability till the end and increases the jumping effeciency of the bot..
after the take off the bot closes the joints i.e.decreases the joint angles in order to avoid collision with the obstacle.
