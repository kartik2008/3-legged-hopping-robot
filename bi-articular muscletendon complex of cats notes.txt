Advantage of hydraulic actuator is that it produces high force but a high energy source is required to drive it which leads to increase in size and weight of the robot and is difficult to produce instantaneous motions.
Pneumatic cylinders are small in size but produce small output and is not suitable for precise control.
Advantages of electric rotary motors are :- excellent conntrollability, light weight and compact size as well as low cost.
Pantogarphic mechanism is a four bar mechanism (the bars are arranged in order to form a parralelogram).
In the example of Cheetah Club(SLP design) a compression spring is connected along the daignol of the parralelogram of the pantographic mechanism.
This is used for force transmission and stores some part of the energy after landing.
ASLP design(Advanced spring loaded pantograph):- one bar is replaced with a spring.
ASLP works more robustly than SLP.
In the bi-articular muscletendon complex of cats design the knee joint is driven by electric rotary motor and ankle joint is kept passive and an extension spring is used in the EFLM.
Impact/Shock from the ground reaction force must be taken into account as leads to damaging of the robot while landing.

The main disadvantage of using this jumping mechanism is it's cost of manufacturing.
The four bar linkage system is available as an actuator in the market which is quite expensive.


Doubts:-
1)why does backdrivability occur while using a gearbox of any reduction ratio and what is it's importance?
2)are actuators and motors similar?
